## Development process

I am generally a believer that form should follow function, or that least that functionality should be prioritized over aesthetics.

Thus my process was to largely ignore the graphical design of the final webpage while working on the logic and functionality of the game, only touching minor styling elements when attempting to distance myself from a difficult bug that was getting the better of me mentally.mainly

On the topic of difficult bugs to solve, when presented with such challenges, and unable to overcome them alone for a certain amount of time, my process was to either talk to a peer who was at a similar stage in the development process or help someone else solve issues in their code. This allowed me to return to the problem with a potentially different perspective and avoid wasting too much time on an overly complicated or unachievable solution.

## User stories

- As a player, I would like to be able to log in to the game with a user and password I have created.

- As a player, I would like to be able to see my game history, including how many games I have finished, in my account.

- As a player, I would like to be able to click a square and have it register as "mine".

- As a player, I would like to see visually when I have won or lost a game, and have the game board reset.

- As a player, I want to play with friends on other devices so that we don't have to sit at one keyboard.

## Unsolved problems

There are a number of desired features which have not yet been implemented, and were surplus to requirements, and thus afforded low priority. Chief among these is the aesthetic of the page, which is currently in a state I would consider a bare minimum level of design. The page is also completely lacking in responsive design, and works poorly on phones (and has not been tested on tablets).

Other more technical areas which I would like to expand upon are the ability to support cross-device multiplayer, the ability to retrieve and resume an unfinished game, and support for some customization of the tokens used for the game.
